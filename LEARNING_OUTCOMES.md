### Learning outcomes

#### General learnings
- Project like this is complex even for something quite simple.
- Everything takes longer than you expect - EVERYTHING
- LLMs are an incredible resource for prototyping and learning but error prone with smaller libraries and specific details

#### Project management learnings
- There are compromises from the very start - trade-offs on what is possible vs time available
  - Using simple approach such as complex feature vs simple feature really helpful
- Important to keep a log of decisions and progress

#### Data managment learnings
- Using other people's data is always a pain

#### Development work
- When working across files it's really important to update across files at same time and have clear naming convention
  - eg when updating a function it can impact 3+ other files and copying over the correct code = critical
- Most documentation isn't very useful for beginners
- Documentation is great but takes time to read and apply to your context
